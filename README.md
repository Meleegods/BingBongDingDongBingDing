Bruce speaking. I consider myself to be a very peculiar fellow, indeed indeed.
As for my interests, I love playing games, listening to music and drawing.
I am, however, socially akward and don't know how to properly approach people.
You can talk to me about things and I'll try my best to relate.

Helo my name is Michael I like reading manga and manhwa. I also like drawing and baking. My friends call me an emo. I am very socially anxious please talk to me
